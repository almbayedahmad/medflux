# Docs Index

Welcome to the MedFlux documentation. Start with these:

- Architecture Overview: architecture_overview.md
- Contributor Guide: CONTRIBUTOR_GUIDE.md
- Repository Structure: STRUCTURE.md
- Validation Playbook: validation_playbook.md
- Logging Guide: ../core/logging/README.md
- Monitoring Stack: ../tools/monitoring/README.md
- Branch Protection: BRANCH_PROTECTION.md

Tips
- Run from the repo root so relative paths resolve (`PYTHONPATH='.'`).
- Use `tools/TOOLS.md` for a catalog of helper scripts and common commands.
