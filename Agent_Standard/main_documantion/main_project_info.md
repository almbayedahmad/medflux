## 1. Project Vision and Scope
FluxAI is an AI-driven healthcare platform designed to accelerate processes and analyze large data sets within German hospitals.
The program consists of multiple **modules**, for example:

- **Contract Processing Module:** automatically reads and analyzes hospital maintenance and procurement contracts, extracting key terms and compliance information.
- **Medical Device Evaluation Module:** evaluates and rates medical devices used in the hospital to support investment and replacement planning.
- **Bed Occupancy Prediction Module:** predicts the number of occupied beds per department to optimize capacity and resource allocation.
- **Future Modules:** additional models can be added based on the success and needs of the project.

**Purpose:**
To build an **intelligent system inside the healthcare sector** that speeds up workflows, reduces manual effort, provides a holistic view of data, and improves decision-making processes for German hospitals.

**Target Users:**
Primarily **German hospitals and healthcare organizations** that need faster processing, better data insights, and improved operational efficiency.
